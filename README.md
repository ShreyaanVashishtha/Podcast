# TODOS

- ~Use lazy-load to optimize the images load~
- Try to optimize the HTML and the CSS (too many divs, negative margins iuugh)
- ~Change the image format for lower the size and lesser the user impact~
- Maybe use a [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) to
  serve the images, yes I'm looking at you [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- Migrate from Grid to Flexbox
